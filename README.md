# GnGeo: Neo-Geo Emulator for GNU/Linux

### GnGeo Emulator means

GnGeo is a Neo-Geo emulator for GNU/Linux platform it has a driver system
much like that of MAME and is quite fast.

Dependencies for Debian/Ubuntu Linux:
-------------------------------------

    # apt install gawk libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev nasm zlib1g-dev

Required firmware (BIOS):
-------------------------

To play some games on the emulator, you need to have the proprietary
Neo-Geo firmware (BIOS).

The necessary firmwares are:

 * 000-lo.lo
 * aes-bios.bin (A.E.S)
 * asia-s3.rom (Asia)
 * sp-s2.sp1 (Europe)
 * usa_2slt.bin (USA)
 * uni-bios.rom
 * vs-bios.rom (Japan)

All files have to be zipped in "**neogeo.zip**" and this file has to be placed
in the roms directory within GnGeo.

> **uni-bios.rom** - You can download the latest version at
> this link: http://unibios.free.fr

If have similar files as: (*sfix.sfix, sm1.sm1*), just rename them properly.

You can configure your bios in **$HOME/.gngeo/gngeorc**.
